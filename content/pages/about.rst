About Me
########

My Name is Tyler Clair and I am currently the Instructional Tools Administrator for Utah State University.
My primary role is to administer our instance of the `Instructure Canvas LMS <https://www.canvaslms.com>`_, but I also administer numerous other systems that are used in conjunction with Canvas.

Currently I administer:

* Instructure Canvas
* Adobe Connect
* WebEx
* 3rd party LTI Tools
* Panopto
  
I have a passion for tinkering, programming, 3D design, and 3D printing.
